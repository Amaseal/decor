  WE ARE CAT AND DOG PEOPLE. We love animals and we are passionate about
  beautiful, extraordinary and functional interior design items.


  Keeping all this in mind, we have designed a multipurpose design object that will perfectly suit in every pet-lover’s house!


  PETS SLEEPING PLACE – COFFEE TABLE – FLOWERPOT STAND - NIGHT TABLE


  Even if your beloved cat will decline the royal comfort and choose to sleep elsewhere, you will easily find another practical and equally stylish application for the object – use it as a coffee table or a flowerpot stand.


  Painted MDF – white; will perfectly match with the Scandinavian minimalistic interior design!
