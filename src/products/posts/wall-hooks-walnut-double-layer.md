  Coat rack and key holder is of course one of the basic necessities in any
  home.


  *


  Our family creates products mostly first for our needs. We finished our house 5 years ago and we produced everything for our house interior in our carpentry. Starting from windows, doors, continuing with kitchen, living room, bedroom, bathroom, furniture, furniture for our kids, our pets furniture and every piece for home decoration. 


  *


  **This particular model is with double layer hooks,** the more the better. But if you are looking for more minimalistic look see our other listings.


  Our coat rack offered with 2x3 and 2x6 hooks – because of its small size, our coat rack can fit in almost anywhere – from your hall, bathroom, and kitchen to your bedroom.


  *


  Nice option is to place coat racks next to each other if you’re in need of more space for your clothes or one above the other and use smaller one for keys.


  Perfect for hanging clothing: coats, hats, tote bags, towels, also keys, use to put sun glasses or mail, etc. or have it as a tasty wall decoration when not in use.


  **Materials:**


  Natural Oak varnished with natural and black colour


  **Dimensions:**


  **2x3 hooks** - 7,5" (19cm) wide / 2,8" (7cm) deep / 5,3" ( 13,5cm) tall


  **2x6 hooks** - 16,5" (42cm) wide / 2,8" (7cm) deep / 5,3" ( 13,5cm) tall


  **Mounting:**


  We will add dowels and screws to the rack, but please ensure correct dowels & screws are used to mount rack to your specific wall. Load capacity will vary depending on dowels & screws.


  **Note:** Wood is a living material which changes imperceptibly over time. All wood reacts to sunlight, humidity, temperature & can vary in grain pattern & colouration.


  **FYI:** It is possible to pack 2 pcs in one shipment for one price.
