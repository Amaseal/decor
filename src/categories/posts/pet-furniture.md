  TERMS AND GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS


  \-	Keep this product in dry, heated premises, maintaining the room temperature above 10°C and relative air humidity of 40% - 60%.


  \-	Be aware that exposure to direct sunlight may change the colour and the visual appearance of the item over time: i.e.  bleach the surface, cause cracks of the lacquer or paint finish. 


  \-	Do not place on the surface of the item any objects heavier than 20 kg on polyhedron and 85 kg on trapeze. 


  \-	In case you spill water on the furniture, to avoid any water stains and swelling, dry clean it immediately with a soft, absorbent cloth (especially important in case you use the polyhedron as a flowerpot stand or a vase). 


  \-	In case of other stains, remove them immediately using a cleaning product intended for wooden surfaces; 


  \-	Do not use abrasive cleaning products! We recommend using a microfiber cloth for everyday cleaning as it will not damage the surfaces of the item. Do not use any solvents or any abrasive materials as they can damage the surfaces of the item. 


  \-	Use felt pads to protect the surface of the item and floor from scratches.


  \-	To move the polyhedron, lift it from the floor by holding it at the bottom. Do not lift the item by placing one hand in the opening and grabbing at the upper surface – as there is the risk of slipping out and back injury. Move it by pushing. In such a case apply felt pads beforehand to avoid surface scratching risk. 


  RECOMMENDATIONS IF YOU INTEND TO USE THE PRODUCT  AS YOUR PETS SLEEPING PLACE


  \-	Avoid being insistent, give your pet the time for discovering and getting used to the new item. 


  \-	Cat people may attract the cat’s attention to the item by placing some drops of catnip or valerian in the polyhedron. 


  \-	To make the sleep more comfortable, place in the polyhedron your pet’s favourite blanket or pillow. 


  \-	Do not feel embittered if your pet does not instantly become attached to the polyhedron, maybe turning or moving it to another location will help!


  \-	Maybe your pet will prefer the product for making a midday nap or as a hiding spot and will sleep over the night elsewhere. 


  \-	Keep in mind that this design object can be easily used also for other purposes: as a coffee table, flowerpot stand or a night table!
