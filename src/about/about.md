      SG Home Décor  part of our family business.


      Everyday we produce high quality bespoke carpentry and joinery from wood and other materials. But apart from bigger projects we create beautifully designed things- decors, craft kits and furniture for nicer  living. 


      Our family and business lives and works in a small village  SKRIVERI  ( Latvia) with community of 3000 people. We are happy to employ and to serve locals. We love and are proud to live on country side.
